  \STLCExamples

  \STLCHideExample

  This shows how we can align code from multiple macros with intermediate
  prose.
  \begin{AgdaAlign}
    \STLCSizeI*
    Explain what we do in this case \dots
    \STLCSizeII*
    \dots and some more explanation here
    \STLCSizeIII*
    \dots and look at the nicely aligned equals signs!
  \end{AgdaAlign}
